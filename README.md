Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was to design an app to read sold groccery items from a file.  The file contained words for each item sold.  The goal was to read the file and provide three outputs.
  1. Show total frequency of each word 2. Output a user specifeid item frequency 3. Output a histogram of each item sold

What did you do particularly well?
I feel I accomploshied good modularity in this program.  I was able to design functinos to be called and eliminate redundant code.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by returning values to C++ for output instead of outputting everything from Python.  This would make the program run more quickly.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of writing this code was keeping track of syntax between Python and C++.  I used google as my main source to help me remeber how to properly
wrtit functinos in Python.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills from this project that will transfer are writing functions and classes.  I felt this project was good practice in OOP, and I can use this moving forward.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by focusing on OOP.  By creating functions and classes I reduced the code needed in main,
made it easier to make small changes, and increased the readabilty by having well commented function discriptions.
